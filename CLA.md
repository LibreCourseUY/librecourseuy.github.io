# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## LibreCourseUY

**Last updated:** February 28, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Preamble

LibreCourseUY is an open community dedicated to improving access to knowledge and building useful open resources in the public interest.

The project welcomes contributions from students, teachers, developers, researchers, and the general public. It is community-led, independent, and not an official channel of any university, faculty, government body, or private institution.

This CLA governs the legal terms under which contributions are submitted and accepted. Community behavior, collaboration norms, and identity rules may also be governed by other project documents, including `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `TRADEMARK.md`.

---

## 1. What counts as a Contribution

A **Contribution** is any material intentionally submitted for inclusion in LibreCourseUY, including source code, documentation, design assets, scripts, translations, datasets, configuration, media, or other copyrightable material.

Casual conversation, general feedback, or discussion that is not clearly intended for inclusion in the project does not count as a Contribution.

---

## 2. Your representations

By submitting a Contribution, you represent that:

- you have the legal authority to submit it;
- you are the original author, or you have sufficient rights and permission to submit it under this Agreement;
- the Contribution does not knowingly infringe third-party rights;
- the Contribution does not include confidential or restricted material;
- the Contribution does not violate employment, academic, institutional, or contractual obligations that apply to you; and
- the Contribution does not introduce license conflicts with the repository's stated license, unless maintainers expressly approve it in writing.

If you contribute as part of your job, internship, scholarship, funded research, or institutional role, you also represent that you have the authority to do so.

---

## 3. License grant

Unless a repository clearly states otherwise, accepted Contributions are incorporated under the repository's license, which will normally be the **MIT License**.

You grant LibreCourseUY and downstream recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and otherwise exercise the rights necessary to include and distribute your Contribution under the repository's applicable license.

This Agreement does **not** transfer your entire copyright ownership unless there is a separate written agreement that says so.

---

## 4. Patent license

If your Contribution includes patentable subject matter that you control, you grant a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free patent license to the extent necessary to use, modify, and distribute the Contribution as part of the project under the applicable repository license.

---

## 5. No trademark or institutional license

This Agreement does not grant rights to use:

- the name **LibreCourseUY**;
- repository or organization names;
- project logos or visual identity;
- third-party trademarks; or
- the names, logos, seals, or institutional identity of universities, faculties, public agencies, or private entities.

Open source licensing and trademark permission are different things.

---

## 6. Commits and acceptance workflow

LibreCourseUY may require cryptographically signed commits for traceability and attribution. Signed commits help verify identity and integrity, but they do **not** by themselves replace explicit acceptance of this CLA when the project requires a separate acceptance step.

This CLA is accepted when you confirm it through a project-approved electronic mechanism, such as:

- an explicit acceptance comment on a pull request;
- a checkbox or web form;
- a CLA bot or similar workflow; or
- another clear electronic acceptance method chosen by the maintainers.

The project may refuse to merge Contributions until that acceptance is recorded.

---

## 7. No employment or compensation

Submitting a Contribution does not create:

- employment;
- compensation rights;
- partnership;
- agency;
- institutional representation; or
- authority to act on behalf of LibreCourseUY.

---

## 8. Warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability

Unless required by law, Contributions and project materials are provided **"AS IS"**, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, LibreCourseUY and its maintainers are not liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising from the use, distribution, or inability to use the project or any Contribution.

---

## 9. Irrevocability

Once a Contribution is accepted and merged, the rights granted under this Agreement are irrevocable, except in cases of material misrepresentation or lack of authority to grant those rights.

Removing content later from a repository does not automatically revoke rights already granted for existing copies, forks, releases, or prior distributions.

---

## 10. Changes to this Agreement

LibreCourseUY may update this CLA in the future. New versions apply only to Contributions submitted after the new version takes effect, unless a contributor expressly agrees otherwise.

---

## 11. Severability

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

---

## 12. Governing law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, excluding conflict-of-law rules, unless mandatory law requires otherwise.

Any dispute arising from this Agreement will be submitted to the competent courts of Montevideo, Uruguay, unless mandatory law requires otherwise.
